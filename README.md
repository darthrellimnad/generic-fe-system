Unidirectioinal arrows connect 3 main bubbles clockwise in a circle (from top: "UI", "Asyc Events", and "Event Stream Processing and State Management". "Ins" of the system are from a human interaction or "remote sources", with arrow pointing to "Async Events".  "Outs" of the system are labeled "Side Effects", and connected with an outgoing arrow from "Event Stream and State Management" bubble.
