![Diagram that describes flow of execution in a front-end, digital system. Unidirectional arrows connect 3 main bubbles clockwise in a circle, suggesting a "loop" (from top: "User Interface (UI)", "Async Events" and "Event Stream Processing and State Management (ESPSM)". "Ins" of the system are from human interaction or "Remote Sources", with arrow pointing to "Async Events" bubble.  "Outs" of the system are presented to the user via UI, or otherwise labeled "Side Effects" and connected with an outgoing arrow from "ESPSM" bubble. Check the raw SVG for labels and descriptors.](Generic-FE-System.drawio.svg)
